# Levelling Up Academia – Web Version

## Project Overview
Levelling Up Academia is an IIT Bombay research-oriented project focused on improving the evaluation of academic researchers. Traditional metrics such as the number of publications and citations are widely used but suffer from several limitations and biases. This project aims to create a more robust, fair, and data-driven system for assessing scholarly work.

## Motivation
Current academic evaluation systems rely heavily on limited measures, each with inherent flaws. These measures often fail to capture the true impact, quality, and consistency of a researcher’s contributions. This project addresses these shortcomings by proposing improved evaluation methods and comparing them with existing approaches.

## Objectives
- Study and understand existing academic evaluation metrics
- Identify limitations in current assessment methods
- Propose and implement improved evaluation measures
- Theoretically analyze different measures and provide insights
- Empirically compare proposed methods with traditional metrics

## Web Application Features
- Web-based interface for uploading academic datasets
- Automated processing and evaluation of researcher metrics
- Generation of structured evaluation reports in PDF format
- Interactive and user-friendly analysis interface
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation


## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask / Streamlit
- HTML & CSS
- Data analysis libraries (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
- PDF generation tools

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python web_app.py
